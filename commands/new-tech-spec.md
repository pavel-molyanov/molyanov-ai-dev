# Instructions

## Project Documentation Autosync

If this command changes any project-local `.claude/**` file, immediately run:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/sync-to-codex.sh --project "$PWD" --apply
```

If sync reports a conflict, stop and report it. Include generated `.codex/**` changes in the same commit as the `.claude/**` source change.

Use the `tech-spec-planning` skill.
