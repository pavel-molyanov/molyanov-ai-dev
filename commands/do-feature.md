# Do Feature

## Project Documentation Autosync

If this command changes any project-local `.claude/**` file, immediately run:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/sync-to-codex.sh --project "$PWD" --apply
```

If sync reports a conflict, stop and report it. Include generated `.codex/**` changes in the same commit as the `.claude/**` source change.

Execute a full feature using a team of agents.

## Step 1: Load Skill

Invoke Skill tool: `Skill(skill: "feature-execution")`

## Step 2: Find Feature

1. User provides feature path or name
2. Read `work/{feature}/tech-spec.md` — verify exists and approved
3. Read `work/{feature}/tasks/` — verify task files exist
4. If tech-spec or tasks missing → stop, tell user what's needed

## Step 3: Execute

Follow the loaded feature-execution skill workflow.
The skill checks `checkpoint.yml` in Phase 1 and handles resume automatically.
